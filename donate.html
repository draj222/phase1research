                <p class="reason-description" id="eventswhy">Phase 1 Research has successfully hosted an event in India where underprivileged students were given opportunities that they can create themselves and teach each other, while benefiting from the portable solar kit each student received in order to combat common power cuts. To be able to provide students around the world with more resources and events such as what we have held, we will need funding to be able to ensure the success of our goals. Currently, we are working towards providing free computers to students in Kenya, along with a Phase 1 Research developed Basics of Computer Science curriculum book for students to work along with. Although we have a few computers ready to donate, we will need support with shipment and gathering more resources as well.</p>

                <p class="reason-description" id="estabwhy">Our long term goals consist of building a small educational facility in Kenya for students to collaborate with each other and mentors on how to solve problems, specifically in computer science. With computers, desks, and the overall structure of the building, we will be able to effectively match students with mentors/teachers to guide them throughout their journey in this field. With funding, we will be able to make dreams come true.</p>
